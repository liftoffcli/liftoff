# Liftoff

**Liftoff is a CLI for configuring opinionated defaults for new Xcode projects.**

* Add default .gitignore and .gitattributes files. Read more about this in our blog post: [Xcode and git: bridging the gap](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/33796217972/xcode-and-git-bridging-the-gap).
* Set the indentation level (4 spaces by default. No tabs, the way God intended)
* Treat warnings as errors for release schemes.
* Enable `-Wall` for all build schemes
* Add a build phase shell script that [turns "TODO:" and "FIXME:" into warnings](http://deallocatedobjects.com/posts/show-todos-and-fixmes-as-warnings-in-xcode-4).
