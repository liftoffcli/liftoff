**Liftoff is a CLI for creating and configuring iOS Xcode projects.**

## Installation

    brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
    brew install liftoff

Note that Liftoff was previously distributed via RubyGems. This method of
installation has been deprecated, and all new releases will be done through
Homebrew. If you are migrating from RubyGems, you should uninstall the gem
version to avoid confusion in the future.

## Usage

Run this command in a directory

    liftoff

When Liftoff finds an existing project in the current directory, it will
perform the following configurations:

* Set the indentation level (In spaces, 4 by default).
* Treat warnings as errors for release schemes
* Enable [warnings] at the project level
* Turn on Static Analysis for the project
* Add a build phase shell script that [turns "TODO:" and "FIXME:" into
  warnings][deallocated-todo]
* Add default [.gitignore] and [.gitattributes] files.
* Initialize a new `git` repo and create an initial commit (if needed).

[.gitignore]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/gitignore
[.gitattributes]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/gitattributes
[warnings]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/defaults/liftoffrc#L15-L32
[deallocated-todo]: http://deallocatedobjects.com/posts/show-todos-and-fixmes-as-warnings-in-xcode-4

When you run Liftoff in a directory without a project file, it will create a
new directory structure for a project, and generate a well-configured Xcode
project in that subdirectory:

```
$ cd ~/dev/
$ liftoff
Project name? MyCoolApp
Company name? thoughtbot
Author name? Gordon Fontenot
Prefix? MCA
Creating MyCoolApp
Creating MyCoolApp/Categories
Creating MyCoolApp/Classes
[snip]
```

Liftoff will generate a brand new project for you based on the provided
values. Generating projects via Liftoff has these advantages:

* Minimized time reorganizing the repository
* Sets up `git` repository automatically
* Defined group structure
* Matching directory structure on disk (linked to the proper group)
* Easily customizable
* Configurations can be shared easily

### Configuration

You can use a `liftoffrc` file to speed up your workflow by defining your
preferred configuration for Liftoff.

Liftoff will look for config files in the local directory and then the home
directory. If it can't find a key in `./.liftoffrc` or `~/.liftoffrc`, it will
use [the default](https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/defaults/liftoffrc).
Check the default for a list of available options.

We highly recommend using `~/.liftoffrc` to define the `author` configuration:

```yaml
author: Gordon Fontenot
```

This will speed up data entry when creating new projects. It can also be
useful to create context-specific `.liftoffrc` files for personal or work
uses. So I can create `~/work-projects/.liftoffrc` that looks like so:

```yaml
company: thoughtbot
```

Now any new project started inside my `work-projects` directory will
automatically default to using `thoughtbot` as the company name. Then I can do
the same for my `personal` directory so that projects created there have a
different default. Note that this can be applied to any of the settings inside
the `liftoffrc`. So if your company dictates a specific folder structure, you
can define that in your company's `liftoffrc` to make sure that those projects
conform to your guidelines.

### Directory Structure and Templates

One of the most powerful things that Liftoff can do for you is let you quickly
and easily customize your project's group and directory structure. By defining
a YAML dictionary inside your local or user `.liftoffrc`, you can completely
dictate the structure that will be created. This includes group structure,
order, placement of template files, etc. And remember that these groups will
be mimicked on disk as well.

You can also create your own templates, or override the defaults by adding
them to `~/.liftoff/templates` or `./.liftoff/templates`. Liftoff will use the
same fallback order when looking for templates as it does for the
`.liftoffrc`.

These files (and filenames) will be parsed with `ERB`, using the values
provided at run time (or the default values from a `liftoffrc`).

There are a few default template files available to you:

- [`<%= prefix %>AppDelegate.h`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/%3C%25%3D%20prefix%20%25%3EAppDelegate.h)
- [`<%= prefix %>AppDelegate.m`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/%3C%25%3D%20prefix%20%25%3EAppDelegate.m)
- [`<%= project_name %>-Info.plist`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/%3C%25%3D%20project_name%20%25%3E-Info.plist)
- [`<%= project_name %>-Prefix.pch`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/%3C%25%3D%20project_name%20%25%3E-Prefix.pch)
- [`main.m`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/main.m)
- [`UnitTests-Info.plist`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/UnitTests-Info.plist)
- [`UnitTests-Prefix.pch`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/blob/master/templates/UnitTests-Prefix.pch)

There is also a template directory for the [`Images.xcassets`][images] asset library.
